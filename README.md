Hey guys,

The banking system project will have four options:
d - to deposit 
s - to withdraw 
e - bank statement
q - exit 
There is no deposit limit, but withdrawals can only be made three times a day with a limit of R$500.00 per withdrawal.
Additionally, the bank statement option will show all actions taken and account balance.

Thank you.
